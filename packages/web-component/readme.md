### Generating New Icons

To add new icons to the project, follow these steps:

1. **Copy SVG File**: Place your SVG file into the `src/icons` directory.

2. **Generate Icons**: Navigate to the `web-components` folder and run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run generate:icons
    ```

    This script will automatically generate the necessary components for the new icon based on the SVG file.

3. **Access New Icon**: Once the script has executed successfully, your new icon will be available in the `src/components/icons` directory.

By following these steps, you can efficiently add new icons to the project without the need for manual editing of existing components.
